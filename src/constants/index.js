const aboutMe = {
  desc: `I am skilled software developer with experience in TypeScript, JavaScript and 
        expertise in frameworks like React, Node.js, and Three.js. 
        
        Through my current course in Web and Mobile development and with few years of experience as a software developer. 
        I learned how to create software at a professional level that satisfies all of the client's
        expectations as a result of my passion for learning new skills and technologies. 
        I also worked on my client communication skills and project estimation. Moreover, 
        my technical expertise and people's abilities enabled me to deliver a superior 
        product while strengthening client connections.
        
        Coding is like magic to me;in addition to learning new languages, I also experiment with new frameworks, 
        algorithms, and approaches to find solutions to issues that can be utilized to develop 
        software that will make people's daily lives easier. I look forward to using my skills in 
        my new Canadian career!`,
